# About

This lets you unpack the sfai file that contains all of the data from Darkfall or Darkfall: Unholy Wars.
I didn't write the original code, I just fixed it up to work with UW.
It also contains scripts for converting models. I've successfully used this to import DF models and sounds in to other games before.

## Things working:
* Static models
* Textures
* Sounds
* XML files

## Things not working:
* Animated models
* Collision meshes
